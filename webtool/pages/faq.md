## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I cite this tool in my research paper?

Please refer to the [How to cite](/page/citing/) page.

### What query syntax can I use?

Most standard search engine query syntax is supported. An 
[overview of syntax you can use](/page/query-syntax/) is available.

### How complete is the data?

Generally speaking, all posts made since scraping started are available, as 
well as some older posts that were included in the initial scrapes. If the 
data you're interested in is located near the beginning of the dataset, it
is probably a good idea to triangulate it with other archives or the platform
itself to confirm the completeness.
