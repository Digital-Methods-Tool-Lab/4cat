## Data Policy

We collect the following data:

- Your IP address and the URL through which you query our web tool will be 
  logged by our web server. This is required to  monitor web server use, and 
  detect errors and abuse.

If you use our web tool to query 4CAT, we additionally save the following 
data:

- Any data provide as input for the 4CAT search tools. We need this to cache 
  results, perform your search queries more efficiently and reduce strain on 
  our server. This data is not linked to your IP address, but if it contains 
  personal information this will be saved on our server as part of the query 
  data. 
  
  Other users of 4CAT may see your query in the tool's interface. They will 
  not be able to see what account was used to submit the query, only the query 
  itself.

If you access our web tool with a personal account, we additionally save the 
following data:

- Your e-mail address, which we use to identify you and to allow you to log in 
  to your personal account.
  
- Any search query you perform will be linked to the account you are logged in 
  with. This makes it easier for you to revisit past queries and access your 
  search results. We may also use this data to detect abuse and excessive usage 
  of our web tool. 
  
We do not share any of this data with anyone else. Anonymised data may be used 
as part of research projects.

If you want to see or remove your personal data, please contact us at 
[4cat@oilab.eu](mailto:4cat@oilab.eu). Please allow up to four weeks for us to 
respond to you. We may ask you for further information to help us accurately 
respond to your request. 

Note that removal of personal data will usually involve removing your account, 
which will also limit your access to the 4CAT web tool.
