## Data Policy

We collect the following data:

- Your IP address will be logged by our web server. This is required to monitor web server use, and detect errors and 
  abuse.

If you use our web tool, we additionally save the following data:

- Any data you use as input for the 4CAT search tools. We need this to cache results, perform your search queries more
  efficiently and reduce strain on our server. This data is not linked to your IP address, but if it contains personal
  information this will be saved on our server as part of the query data.

If you access our web tool with a personal account, we additionally save the following data:

- Your e-mail address, which we use to identify you and to allow you to log in to your personal account.
- Any search query you perform will be linked to the account you are logged in with. This makes it easier for you to
  revisit past queries and access your search results. We may also use this data to detect abuse and excessive usage of
  our web tool. 
  
We do not share any of this data with anyone else. Anonymised or aggregate data may be used as part of research 
projects.

If you want to see or remove your personal data, please contact us at [4cat@oilab.eu](mailto:4cat@oilab.eu). Please 
allow up to four weeks for us to respond to you. We may ask you for further information to help us accurately respond to
your request. 

Note that removal of personal data will usually involve removing your account, which will also limit your access to the
4CAT web tool.
